## Context
- Completing a working Tik-Tak-Toe game from scratch using css javascript and html
- I am now 6 weeks into the fornt end program at Turing 
  
## Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
  
## Wins and Challenges
- Challenge 1: was understanding how im going to have my win condition and I was able to overcome this by talking with other clasmates as well as some of my friends and bouncing ideas off back and forth until i came up with one that seemed feasible 
- Challenge 2: The amout of bugs that my change turns function ended up giving me and this was fixed by giving my check win and check draw function a return of false and then using both of them in my if statment to then only change turns after its been decdied its not a draw or a win 
- Win 1: my functions are very clean for the most part due to me having to do a lot of bug fixing i ended up making my functions all perform one task allowing me to debug a lot easier 
- Win 2: I was able to meet all of my goals on this project without looking up much of anything just a few css styling for a board and I consider this an amazing win due to me not having the greatest memory yet being able to do most of this project without having to find things means a lot to me personally!
